## *What is Thymeleaf ?*

* Thymeleaf is a modern server-side Java template engine for both web and standalone environments, capable of processing HTML, XML, JavaScript, CSS and even plain text.
* The main goal of Thymeleaf is to provide an elegant and highly-maintainable way of creating templates. To achieve this, it builds on the concept of Natural Templates to inject its logic into template files in a way that doesn’t affect the template from being used as a design prototype. This improves communication of design and bridges the gap between design and development teams.
* Thymeleaf has also been designed from the beginning with Web Standards in mind – especially HTML5 – allowing you to create fully validating templates if that is a need for you.
